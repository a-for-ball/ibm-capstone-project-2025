# üöÄ SpaceX Launch Analysis & Prediction Dashboard

This project explores SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data to analyze trends, geographical insights, and build predictive models for launch success. It combines exploratory data analysis, interactive visualization using Dash, and classification modeling with scikit-learn.

## üß≠ Methodology Summary

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Merged multiple launch datasets
   - Created derived columns for success, orbit type, booster category, and geospatial markers

2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Used `folium` to visualize launch site locations and success distribution
   - Examined proximities to coastline, highways, and railways

3. **Interactive Dashboard**
   - Built with `Dash` and `Plotly`
   - Dropdowns and sliders allow filtering by site and payload range
   - Pie chart and scatter plot show success metrics and payload-outcome trends

4. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Trained Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN classifiers
   - Evaluated using test accuracy and cross-validation
   - Visualized confusion matrix for best-performing model

## üìä Summary of Results

- **Geographic Insights**
  - All launch sites are near the coastline and clustered near the equator
  - CCAFS LC-40 is closest to a highway and railway

- **Dashboard Findings**
  - KSC LC-39A has the highest success ratio (76.9%)
  - Launches with medium payloads tend to succeed more often
  - Certain booster versions correlate strongly with success

- **Classification Results**
  - Logistic Regression and SVM achieved highest test accuracy (83%)
  - Cross-validation showed consistent performance (~80%)
  - Logistic Regression showed very few false negatives in its confusion matrix

- **Key Orbit Observations**
  - LEO success increases with launch frequency
  - No clear pattern found for success vs. flight count in GTO

## üîç Key Questions Answered

**Q1: Can we predict the price of a SpaceX launch using publicly available data?**  
Yes ‚Äî to a reasonable extent. Factors like payload mass, orbit type, and launch site can serve as proxies for estimating launch costs. While exact pricing isn‚Äôt public, patterns in these variables enable approximate modeling.

**Q2: Can we accurately predict whether a Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully?**  
Yes. Classification models using historical data reached up to **83% accuracy** on test sets. Logistic Regression performed particularly well with minimal false negatives.
